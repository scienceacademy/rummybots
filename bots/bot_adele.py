"""Student Bot Template — start building your bot here!

Instructions:
1. Rename this file to something like "bot_<name>.py"
2. Rename the class to something like "MyBot"
3. Implement your strategy in the three required methods
4. Test your bot by running it against the sample bots

Available information in 'view' (a PlayerView object):
- view.hand:              Your current cards (list of Card objects)
- view.discard_pile:      All discarded cards so far (list)
- view.top_of_discard:    The top card of the discard pile (or None)
- view.deck_size:         Number of cards left in the deck
- view.opponent_hand_size: Number of cards in opponent's hand
- view.phase:             Current game phase

Useful utility functions (import from framework.utilities):
- calculate_deadwood(hand)         → Your total deadwood points
- is_gin(hand)                     → True if deadwood is 0
- can_knock(hand)                  → True if deadwood <= 10
- get_melds(hand)                  → All possible melds in your hand
- get_best_melds(hand)             → (melds, unmelded) optimal arrangement
- get_unmelded_cards(hand)         → Cards not part of any meld
- best_discard(hand)               → The card to discard for min deadwood
- deadwood_after_discard(hand, c)  → Deadwood if you discard card c
- evaluate_discard_draw(hand, c)   → Best deadwood if you take card c
- card_deadwood_contribution(hand, c) → How much card c hurts your hand

Strategy ideas to try:
- Take from the discard pile when the card completes a meld
- Track what your opponent discards to avoid giving them useful cards
- Only knock when your deadwood is very low (reduces undercut risk)
- Consider which cards are "near" melds (e.g., two of a kind, partial runs)
- Be more aggressive about knocking when the deck is running low
